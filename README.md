_The code does not transfer data over a network. 
It is a static web page with JavaScript code that runs entirely in the user's web browser. 
The JavaScript functions in the code perform calculations and manipulate the content displayed on 
the web page based on user input, but there is no network communication or data transfer involved._

_The code is designed to be a client-side web application, 
meaning it operates locally on the user's device without 
making requests to a server or transferring data to/from a remote location. 
It's primarily for user interaction and local calculations related to IP addresses and CIDR notation._
